RSA Encryption
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure
communication. The RSA algorithm first generates two large random prime numbers, and then use them
to generate public and private key pairs, which can be used to do encryption, decryption, digital signature
generation, and digital signature verification. The RSA algorithm is built upon number theories, and it can
be quite easily implemented with the support of libraries
